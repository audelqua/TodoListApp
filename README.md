This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development and json servers with commands below:

```bash
yarn dev
and 
yarn start_db
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 
Also you can check [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see json-server

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
